        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: 2025-10-23</p>

        <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Car Fault mobile application (the "App") handles information. The App is developed and operated by an independent developer based in the European Union (the "Developer").</p>
        <p>Car Fault does not collect or store any personal data. The App’s purpose is to provide general informational guidance about vehicle warning lights and potential issues.</p>

        <h4>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h4>
        <p>The App does not request, collect, or store personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, contact details, or any form of account registration. It does not track users across other apps or websites, nor does it collect precise location data.</p>

        <h4>3. Information Collected Automatically</h4>
        <p>To help improve performance and user experience, Car Fault uses third-party analytics tools that automatically collect non-identifying technical data. These services include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Firebase Analytics (Google LLC):</strong> collects anonymized metrics such as app session duration, crash reports, and device type. This data cannot be used to personally identify you. Learn more: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Facebook SDK (Meta Platforms, Inc.):</strong> may collect aggregated usage statistics to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. No personal data or identifiers are shared with the Developer. Learn more: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>4. How Analytics Data Is Used</h4>
        <p>Analytics data is used solely for improving app performance, understanding general usage patterns, and identifying areas for optimization. The Developer does not combine or cross-reference analytics data with any personal information.</p>

        <h4>5. Subscriptions and Payments</h4>
        <p>Car Fault offers optional subscription-based features. All payments and billing information are processed exclusively through Apple’s App Store, in accordance with Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>. The Developer does not have access to or store any payment information.</p>

        <h4>6. Data Security</h4>
        <p>The App does not transmit personal data to external servers operated by the Developer. Analytics data handled by third parties (Firebase, Facebook) is managed according to their own security and privacy practices. While reasonable measures are taken to protect all transmitted information, no system can be guaranteed to be fully secure.</p>

        <h4>7. Your Rights and Choices</h4>
        <p>You can limit analytics collection by adjusting privacy and ad-tracking settings on your iOS device. You may also disable personalized advertising in your device settings. Since the App does not store personal data, there is no stored information to delete or export.</p>

        <h4>8. Children’s Privacy</h4>
        <p>The App is not intended for children under 16 years of age. It does not knowingly collect or process personal data from children.</p>

        <h4>9. Changes to This Policy</h4>
        <p>The Developer may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be reflected by revising the “Last updated” date above. Continued use of the App after such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

        <h4>10. Contact</h4>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please <a href="feedback.html" onclick="location.href=this.href+(window.location.search?window.location.search:'');return false;">contact us via the feedback form</a>.</p>
