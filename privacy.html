        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: 2025-10-30</p>

        <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Car Fault mobile application (the "App") handles information. The App is developed and operated by an independent developer based in the European Union (the "Developer").</p>
        <p>Car Fault does not collect or store any personal data. The App provides general informational guidance about vehicle warning lights and potential issues.</p>

        <h4>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h4>
        <p>The App does not request, collect, or store personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, contact details, or account registration. It does not track users across other apps or websites.</p>

        <h4>3. Information Collected Automatically</h4>
        <p>To improve the App and understand usage patterns, Car Fault uses third-party analytics tools that collect non-identifying technical data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Firebase Analytics (Google LLC):</strong> collects anonymized metrics such as session duration, crash reports, and device type. This data is not used to track you across other apps or websites. <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Facebook SDK (Meta Platforms, Inc.):</strong> collects aggregated usage data for marketing campaign measurement. No personal identifiers are shared with the Developer. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>4. How Analytics Data Is Used</h4>
        <p>Data is used solely to improve the App, understand user engagement, and optimize features. Users can disable analytics collection via device settings or app options.</p>

        <h4>5. Subscriptions and Payments</h4>
        <p>Car Fault offers optional auto-renewable subscriptions. All payment and subscription management is handled through Apple’s App Store. The Developer does not have access to payment information. Users can manage or cancel subscriptions in their Apple ID account settings.</p>

        <h4>6. Data Security</h4>
        <p>The App does not transmit personal data to external servers controlled by the Developer. Analytics data is managed according to third-party security policies. No system can be guaranteed fully secure.</p>

        <h4>7. Your Rights and Choices</h4>
        <p>Users can manage analytics preferences via device settings. Since the App does not store personal data, there is no personal information to delete or export.</p>

        <h4>8. Children’s Privacy</h4>
        <p>The App is not intended for children under 16 years. It does not knowingly collect or process personal data from children.</p>

        <h4>9. Changes to This Policy</h4>
        <p>The Developer may update this Privacy Policy. Continued use of the App after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

        <h4>10. Contact</h4>
