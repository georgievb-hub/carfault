        <p>Last updated: 2025-10-23</p>

        <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
        <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the Car Fault mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>
        <p>The App is developed and operated by an independent developer based in the European Union (the "Developer").</p>

        <h4>2. Use of the App</h4>
        <p>The App provides general informational guidance to help users understand car dashboard warning lights, error codes, and potential causes of vehicle issues. The information is for reference purposes only and does not constitute professional mechanical advice or diagnosis.</p>
        <p>You agree to use the App responsibly and acknowledge that any maintenance, inspection, or repair actions based on the App’s content are performed at your own risk.</p>

        <h4>3. No Warranty</h4>
        <p>The App and all information provided within it are offered on an "as is" and "as available" basis. The Developer makes no warranties, express or implied, regarding accuracy, reliability, or suitability for any purpose.</p>

        <h4>4. Limitation of Liability</h4>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Developer shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of or inability to use the App, including but not limited to data loss, vehicle damage, or personal injury.</p>

        <h4>5. Subscriptions & Payments</h4>
        <p>Car Fault offers certain premium features through auto-renewable subscriptions. All subscriptions, renewals, and refunds are managed according to Apple’s App Store policies. The Developer does not directly handle user payment information and cannot issue refunds outside the App Store system.</p>

        <h4>6. Privacy & Data</h4>
        <p>The App does not collect personal data. It uses third-party analytics services, including Firebase Analytics and Facebook integrations, to help understand usage patterns and improve performance.

        <h4>7. Intellectual Property</h4>
        <p>All trademarks, names, content, and graphics displayed in the App are owned by the Developer or their respective owners. You may not reproduce, distribute, or modify the App’s content without prior written permission.</p>

        <h4>8. Disclaimer of Responsibility</h4>
        <p>The App’s diagnostic suggestions are based on generalized automotive knowledge and may not reflect the specific condition of your vehicle. Always consult a qualified automotive technician before performing any repairs or maintenance. The Developer is not responsible for damage or injury resulting from actions taken based on information provided by the App.</p>

        <h4>9. Changes to Terms</h4>
        <p>The Developer may update these Terms periodically. Any updates will be published within the App or on its website, and continued use of the App after such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

        <h4>10. Governing Law</h4>
        <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the European Union, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be handled in accordance with applicable EU consumer protection laws.</p>
